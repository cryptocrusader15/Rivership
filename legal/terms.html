    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    <p>
      Thank you for using River! These Terms of Service (the
      &ldquo;Terms&rdquo; or &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) govern your rights and
      obligations relating to your access to and use of the
      <a href="../app.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://river.com</a>
      website and any other related services, applications, and content provided
      by us (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      BY REGISTERING FOR A USER ACCOUNT OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU HAVE READ,
      UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS
      CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS AND
      RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING LIMITATION OF OUR LIABILITY, BINDING
      ARBITRATION, AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION CLAIMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS
      AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Changes to these Terms</h4>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time, with or
      without notice to you. If you continue to use the Services, you consent to
      the new Terms, as modified. Any changes to these Terms will become
      effective on the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo; indicated above. If you
      continue to use the Services after the Effective Date, you consent to the
      new Terms. We will always have the latest Terms posted on the Services.
    </p>
    <h4>3. Overview of the Services</h4>
    <p>
      The Services provide users an easy-to-use, secure Bitcoin exchange and
      custodial wallet. What separates River from the pack is our deep
      functionality built exclusively around the Bitcoin network. Subject to
      these Terms, users that meet the eligibility requirements described below
      are able to buy, sell, send, receive, and store Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>
      River is a regulated financial institution. As such, we endeavor to comply
      with all laws and regulations applicable to our business, including the
      Bank Secrecy Act (&ldquo;BSA&rdquo;), anti-money laundering and terrorism
      financing (&ldquo;AML&rdquo;) regulations, and federal and state money
      transmission licensing requirements of the states and jurisdictions in
      which we operate.

        of the eligibility criteria for the Service.
      </p>
      <h5>4.2 You must register for a User Account.</h5>
      <p>
        Before being able to use the Services to buy, sell, receive or send
        Bitcoin, you will be required to register for a User Account. You agree
        to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the
        registration process and to update such information to keep it up to
        date. You can only have one River User Account at any time. We reserve
        the right to suspend or terminate your User Account according to these
        Terms if we determine that any information provided by you is inaccurate
        or incomplete. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to open a User
        Account, or limit the number of User Accounts that you may hold or
        suspend or terminate any User Account or the trading of Bitcoin in your
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you register for a User Account on behalf of an entity, you represent
        and warrant that you have authority to (i) accept these Terms on behalf
        of and bind such party, and (ii) provide information on behalf of such
        party.
      </p>
      <h5>4.3 You must safeguard your User Account.</h5>
      <p>
        You are responsible for safeguarding your User Account information,
        including your password. You agree not to disclose your password to, or
        share your User Account with, any third party. You agree to take sole
        responsibility for any activities or actions under your User Account,
        whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will
        immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your User Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that we will not be liable for any loss or harm that you incur
        if someone else uses the Services from any of your devices, either with
        or without your knowledge, and that you will be solely responsible for
        such use, whether or not you authorized the use.
      </p>
      <h5>4.4 We will verify your identity.</h5>
      <p>
        As a regulated financial institution, we are required to obtain
        information about and verify the identity of our users. To comply with
        our BSA/AML obligations, we will request that you provide certain
        information to us about you. This information will be used by us for the
        purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering,
        terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crimes. You agree
        that all such information provided by you will be complete and accurate,
        that you will keep us updated if any of the information you provide
        changes, and that we may keep a record of such information consistent
        with our BSA/AML obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to collecting information from you, we are required to take
        reasonable steps to verify your identity as a user. You expressly
        authorize River to take any and all actions that we reasonably deem
        necessary to verify your identity or protect you and/or us against fraud
        or other financial crime. These may include, but are not limited to,
        engaging third-party services to assist with such verification efforts,
        sharing your information with such third parties, and collecting
        additional information about you from such third parties.
      </p>
      <h5>4.5 Some cases require Enhanced Due Diligence.</h5>
      <p>
        Certain users may be subject to a more rigorous identity verification
        program (&ldquo;Enhanced Due Diligence&rdquo;) consistent with our
        BSA/AML obligations due to the increased risk of money laundering,
        fraudulent activity and sanctions risk. In such cases, you agree to
        comply with River&rsquo;s requests to provide such information and
        documentation as is necessary for us, either directly or through our
        third-party vendors, to complete the Enhanced Due Diligence. You
        acknowledge that if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are
        unable to satisfy the requirements of our Enhanced Due Diligence,
        certain functionalities of the Services may not be available to you.
      </p>
      <h5>4.6 You agree to our Privacy Policy.</h5>
      <p>
        The type of information we collect from and about you as you use the
        Services, as well as how we use, share and retain that information is
        set forth in our <a href="privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Privacy Policy</a>.
        By accessing and using the Services, you grant us the right to use,
        share and retain the information we collect from and about you as
        described in these Terms and in our Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h5>4.7 You may be subject to the terms of a Referral Program.</h5>
      <p>
        We may offer referral programs for inviting others to use the Services
        or for using the Services following such an invitation (a &ldquo;Referral
        Program&rdquo;). Any incentives offered under any such Referral Program are
        subject to the then current Referral Program terms and are additionally
        subject to our sole discretion.
      </p>

    <h4>5. Buying, Selling, Transferring, And Holding Bitcoin</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <h5>5.1 You may buy and sell Bitcoin for U.S. Dollars.</h5>
      <p>
        Subject to the eligibility and verification requirements set forth in
        these Terms, you may buy or sell Bitcoin in exchange for U.S. Dollars
        (&ldquo;USD&rdquo;). We accept transfers of USD into your User Account
        via Automated Clearing House (&ldquo;ACH&rdquo;) transfer or wire
        transfer. We currently do not support the purchase of Bitcoin through
        credit card, debit card, or any other means.
      </p>
      <h5>5.2 We will provide you with a Bitcoin wallet.</h5>
      <p>
        Subject to the eligibility and verification requirements set forth in
        these Terms, we will provide you with a digital wallet to hold Bitcoin
        (a &ldquo;Wallet&rdquo;). You agree and acknowledge that the Wallet only
        supports Bitcoin, and no other digital currencies. You may not attempt
        to transfer to or store in your Wallet any other digital currency or any
        other asset other than Bitcoin. You should verify the details of any
        Bitcoin transaction prior to submitting it to us. River assumes no
        responsibility for any violation, or attempted violation, of the
        foregoing, which may result in loss of assets.
      </p>
      <h5>5.3 You own your Bitcoin.</h5>
      <p>
        River does not own or borrow any Bitcoin in your Wallet. Rather, all
        Bitcoin in your Wallet are custodial assets held by River on your
        behalf. All Bitcoin assets are held in full reserve and do not earn
        interest. You have all rights, title, and interest in and to the Bitcoin
        held by us for your benefit. You have the power to store, sell, or
        transfer all such Bitcoin. Except as required by law or as otherwise set
        forth in these Terms, we do not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of
        your Bitcoin without your consent. As the owner, you alone bear all risk
        of loss, including loss of value, associated with the Bitcoin in your
        Wallet.
      </p>
      <h5>5.4 Bitcoin is not an insured asset.</h5>
      <p>
        You understand and acknowledge that Bitcoin is not subject to
        protections or insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance
        Corporation, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, or any
        other agency or organization. River will have no responsibility or
        liability to you or anyone else for any loss in the value of Bitcoin
        held in your Wallet.
      </p>
      <h5>
        5.5 You may transfer USD to and from your User Account, and you may hold
        USD in your User Account.
      </h5>
      <p>
        You may transfer USD to and from your User Account via ACH. If you elect
        to use ACH transfer in connection with the Services, you must designate
        and connect a valid U.S. bank account to your User Account. River does
        not charge a fee for ACH transfers, but is not responsible for any fees
        charged by your bank.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        You may transfer USD to and from your User Account via wire transfer.
        River charges a fee for wire transfers, which we will communicate to you
        via the Services. River is not responsible for any fees charged by your
        bank. In certain circumstances, and at our sole discretion, we may
        require you to connect a valid U.S. bank account to your User Account to
        continue your use of the Services.&nbsp; If you elect to use wire
        transfers in connection with the Services, you should verify all wire
        information prior to submitting your transaction. River is not
        responsible for transfers that do not include the correct transfer
        information. If you have questions, contact our support team at
        support@river.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are permitted to maintain a balance of USD in your User Account for
        the purpose of using the Services. Your USD balance is held on deposit
        in an account established specifically for our clients&rsquo; benefit.
        The account is legally distinct from our transaction and business
        accounts.
      </p>
      <h5>5.6 You buy Bitcoin from us and sell Bitcoin to us.</h5>
      <p>
        When you place an order to buy Bitcoin through the Services, you are
        requesting to purchase, directly from River, the quantity of Bitcoin
        indicated on your purchase order at the then-applicable Bitcoin
        buy-price listed on the Services and on your purchase order. Subject to
        the requirements set forth in these Terms and as otherwise communicated
        by us to you, when your order executes, we will sell you Bitcoin from
        our reserves, credit such quantity of Bitcoin to your Wallet, and debit
        your designated bank account for the applicable purchase price. When you
        place a buy order through the Services, you expressly authorize us to
        initiate a debit entry to your linked bank account for the amount listed
        in the order, which shall include our transaction fees and any other
        fees as set forth in these Terms. You are required to maintain an
        adequate balance in your bank account to cover the fees associated with
        any Bitcoin you purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, for recurring orders, you authorize us to execute purchases
        on your behalf automatically at the interval of your choosing. You
        authorize us to initiate a debit entry to your linked bank account to
        facilitate recurring orders, and you understand that such debits may occur
        up to one week prior to the scheduled date for your recurring purchase.
        If you do not have sufficient funds available for your recurring orders,
        we may make additional attempts to pull funds. You may cancel recurring
        orders at any time. River may cancel or modify your recurring order for
        any reason in its sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, when you place an order to sell Bitcoin through the
        Services, you are requesting to sell, directly to River, the quantity of
        Bitcoin indicated on your sale order at the then-applicable Bitcoin
        sell-price listed on the Services and on your purchase order. Subject to
        the requirements set forth in these Terms and as otherwise communicated
        by us to you, when your order executes, we will buy such amount of
        Bitcoin from you, deduct such quantity of Bitcoin from your Wallet, and
        credit your designated bank account for the applicable sale price.
      </p>
      <h5>5.7 We set the Bitcoin price listed on the Services.</h5>
      <p>
        We do not make any guarantees or representations as to the accuracy of
        the Bitcoin price listed on the Services as of any point in time. We
        determine the buy-price and sell-price of Bitcoin at our discretion
        based on available market information. River will not be responsible for
        any differences between the buy-price or sell-price of Bitcoin listed on
        the Services (a "River Price") and the prices listed on any third-party
        services.
      </p>
      <h5>5.8 Your User Account may be subject to certain limitations.</h5>
      <p>
        In order to detect money laundering, fraud and other criminal activity,
        we may impose certain limitations on your User Account and your ability
        to buy, sell, and transfer Bitcoin. These may include, but are not
        limited to, the following measures:
      </p>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>
          Subject to these Terms, you may purchase Bitcoin after registering a
          User Account and submitting the required information but before we
          have verified your identity. However, you may not execute any other
          transactions, including transferring Bitcoin into and out of your
          Wallet or selling Bitcoin, until we have verified your identity
          consistent with these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may impose
          <a href="https://support.river.com/kb/guide/en/what-are-my-account-limits-JgtpdKrR9P/Steps/2122122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            limits
          </a>
          <span>
            on the amount of Bitcoin you can buy or sell in a given period. Your
            transaction limits may vary depending on a number of factors,
            including the verification steps you have completed. To view your
            transaction limits, you may review
          </span>

            this

          <span>
            help center article. We reserve the right to change applicable
            limits as we deem necessary in our sole discretion.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Any transfer of USD to your User Account will be subject to a
          settlement period to ensure that the transaction was not fraudulent.
          During this settlement period, any Bitcoin that you buy with these
          funds will appear in your &ldquo;Total Balance,&rdquo; but it will not
          be reflected in your &ldquo;Available Balance&rdquo; (i.e. the amount
          of Bitcoin that is eligible for withdrawal or transfer). Therefore,
          you may not be able to withdraw or transfer unsettled USD or Bitcoin
          during the settlement period.

        <li>
          We may further limit your ability to withdraw or transfer Bitcoin or
          USD. We reserve the right to cancel or reverse any transaction, even
          after funds have been debited from your bank account or Bitcoin has
          been received by us.

      </ul>
      <h5>5.9 We charge transaction fees.</h5>
      <p>
        When you buy or sell Bitcoin using the Services, we charge a transaction
        fee. Our most updated transaction fees are always listed <a href="https://support.river.com/kb/guide/en/what-fees-does-river-charge-for-buy-and-sell-orders-09FWWqEaW5/Steps/2122041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          on the Services</a>.
        We will also notify you of our fees for any transaction before you
        execute a buy or sell order, and we will include such fees on the
        receipt we provide to you after the transaction is complete. By using
        the Services, you agree that we may collect our transaction fees by
        reducing them from your Available Balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that our fees are subject to change. We will provide you
        notice of changes in our fees by posting the changes to the Services or
        otherwise communicate them to you in writing. Your continued use of the
        Services after the effective date of such change will constitute your
        agreement to pay the updated fees.
      </p>
      <h5>5.10 We will collect third-party fees.</h5>
      <p>
        In addition to our fees, we may also charge third-party fees related to
        the execution of a wire or a Bitcoin transaction. We will calculate such
        third-party fees at our discretion, although we will always notify you
        of the fee at or before the time you authorize the transaction. You
        agree that we may collect such third-party fees by reducing them from
        your Available Balance.
      </p>
      <h5>
        5.11 You are responsible for maintaining adequate funds in your bank
        account.
      </h5>
      <p>
        If you do not have sufficient funds in your bank account to cover a
        transaction you initiate through the Services, or in the event of a
        returned transaction, we may take any action we deem necessary and
        appropriate, including reversing the transaction, if possible, or
        withdrawing Bitcoin or USD from your User Account to cover the cost of
        the transaction and any other fees or losses incurred by us as a result
        of insufficient funds or any returned transaction.
      </p>
      <h5>5.12 Bitcoin transactions are not reversible.</h5>
      <p>
        Please be advised that Bitcoin transactions are not reversible. As such,
        once a buy or sell order is completed or is in pending status, it may
        not be cancelled. Similarly, you should exercise caution when making
        transfers from and to your Wallet, as such transactions cannot be
        stopped once initiated.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you or any third party transfers Bitcoin to your Wallet, you must
        use a Bitcoin address or Lightning Network invoice associated with your
        Wallet that is provided to you by us. The transferring party (whether
        you or a third party) shall be solely responsible for executing the
        transaction properly. River assumes no responsibility for, and shall not
        be liable to you or any third party, for any lost Bitcoin or other
        assets as a result of an incorrect Bitcoin address, Lightning Network
        invoice, inadequate network/miner fees, an attempt to transfer any
        digital assets other than Bitcoin to your Wallet, or any other improper
        transfer instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, when you transfer Bitcoin from your Wallet to an external
        address, you are solely responsible for ensuring that the recipient is
        able to receive the Bitcoin and that the instructions you provide to us
        are accurate. River assumes no responsibility for, and shall not be
        liable to you or any third party for, any Bitcoin in your Wallet once an
        outbound transfer is initiated pursuant to your instructions.
      </p>
      <h5>5.13 You are solely responsible for any taxes.</h5>
      <p>
        Your purchase and sale of Bitcoin may be subject to certain tax
        obligations. It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to
        what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct through the
        Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts
        of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Your transaction history is
        available through your User Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        River will default the cost basis method to First In First Out (FIFO) unless you select a different method. Effective February 28,2023, for sells, your cost basis methodology will first be applied to known lots then unknown lots. For withdrawals and sends, unknown lots will be sent first, then known lots. More information on the cost basis methodologies can be found

        5.14 We may be required to report and transfer unclaimed Bitcoin or USD
        to authorities.
      </h5>
      <p>
        If your User Account is closed or becomes inactive, we may be required
        to report any remaining Bitcoin or USD in your User Account to the
        authorities after the passage of applicable waiting periods specified by
        law. If this occurs, we may attempt to contact you at the email or
        mailing address we have on file for you. If we are unable to contact you
        after a reasonable amount of time, we may be required to deliver such
        Bitcoin or USD to the authorities.
      </p>
      <h5>5.15 Our obligations in the event of your death.</h5>
      <p>
        If you have agreed to a Transfer on Death Authorization and Agreement
        (“TODAA”) and we receive notice of your death, we will attempt to
        distribute your account to your designated beneficiaries consistent with
        the terms of your TODAA. These Terms will neither supersede not affect
        your acceptance of the TODAA. In addition to other requirements set
        forth in your TODAA, your beneficiary(ies) will be required to agree to
        the Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have not agreed to a TODAA and we have reason to believe that you
        have died (including if we receive legal documentation of your death),
        we will suspend your User Account. We may also take steps to
        investigate, including through third parties, whether you have died. If
        we reasonably determine that you have died, any Bitcoin or USD in your
        User Account will be held until your designated fiduciary creates a new
        User Account and undergoes our verification procedures set forth in
        these Terms. You agree that your fiduciary may not access your Bitcoin
        or USD unless and until he or she creates a new User Account. We reserve
        the right, at our sole discretion, to effect the transfer of the value
        in your User Account to your fiduciary by selling any Bitcoin in your
        User Account and transferring the USD proceeds to your fiduciary. If you
        have not designated a fiduciary on your User Account, we may either
        require an order designating a fiduciary from a court having competent
        jurisdiction over your estate or otherwise determine a fiduciary
        entitled to inherit your Bitcoin or USD based on our review of your
        will, trust, or other legal documentation.
      </p>
      <h5>5.16 Automatic Withdrawal of your Bitcoin.</h5>
      <p>
        When you set up Bitcoin automatic withdrawals, you are requesting to automatically withdraw a portion of or all of your Bitcoin balance (less fees) from a select River account to a Bitcoin address of your choice. You are able to edit or cancel your automatic withdrawals at any time. If you delete your automatic withdrawals, any automatic withdrawal transactions that are pending will continue to execute as they cannot be canceled. If you edit your automatic withdrawals, any automatic withdrawal transactions that are pending will execute according to the updated settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bitcoin network fees associated with this on-chain Bitcoin transfer will be determined at the time of execution, but will not exceed 3% of your transaction total. When the withdrawal is successfully executed, we will send you a confirmation email with the exact fee deducted from your transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only settled Bitcoin will be withdrawn; more information regarding the settlement period can be found in section '5.8 Your User Account may be subject to certain limitations.'
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for ensuring the provided on-chain Bitcoin address is accurate. More information regarding Bitcoin transactions can be found in section '5.12 Bitcoin transactions are not reversible.'
      </p>
      <h5>5.17 Target Price Orders.</h5>
      <p>
        River may permit you to request a target price order (a "Target Price Order"), which allows you to specify a price (the "Target Price") at which you would like to buy or sell bitcoin and the amount that you would like to buy or sell. A Target Price Order will result in a buy or sell order being placed on your behalf when the River Price matches your Target Price.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you request a Target Price Order, River will restrict the USD (in the case of a buy order) or bitcoin (in the case of a sell order) necessary to complete the Target Price Order, including any applicable fees. If you request to fund your Target Price Order via ACH, you authorize River to withdraw funds from your bank account in the amount sufficient to cover your requested Target Price Order and any applicable fees, and to restrict those funds upon receipt.
      </p>
      <p>
        River cannot guarantee that the Target Price you select will ever be reached. In the event that the Target Price matches the River Price (a "Target Event"), as determined in our sole discretion, you authorize River to place a buy order or sell order as specified by you in the Target Price Order. You may cancel a Target Price Order at any time prior to a Target Event. A Target Price Order may be canceled by River at any time and for any reason, with no liability to you for any losses incurred as a result of such cancelation. Once a Target Price Order is canceled, any USD or bitcoin that has been restricted in connection with the Target Price Order will once again be available for transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Target Price Orders are requested at your own risk. Disruptions to the Services, including rapidly shifting prices or third-party outages, may impact River's ability to execute a Target Price Order and may result in the cancelation of your Target Price Order. We are not liable to you in the event that a Target Price Order is not able to be completed upon a Target Event as a result of any such disruptions.

        Circumstances in which we may limit or prevent your access to our

        MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL
        WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT
        NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ASSUME THE RISK OF ANY AND

        WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES WILL BE
        UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. RIVER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR

      </p>
      <h5>10.4 Our liability to you is limited.</h5>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
        DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
        OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR LOST DATA, REGARDLESS OF THE
        FORESEEABILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
        YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES ARISING
        FROM OR RELATED TO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: ANY HARM OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY,
        OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO, YOUR RELIANCE ON INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH
        THE SERVICES; ANY LOSS OR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF DATA; ANY HARM OR
        DAMAGE CAUSED BY, OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO, YOUR USE OF OR INTERACTION
        WITH ANY SERVICES OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICES; AND ANY VIOLATIONS OF
        APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, AND OTHER AGREEMENTS. THIS
        LIMITATION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY OR FORM OF ACTION.
      </p>
      <p>
        IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
        WITH THESE TERMS AND YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE
        HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00) AND THE FEES THAT YOU HAVE PAID TO US IN THE

      </p>
      <p>
        THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF
        THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND US. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
        ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF

        YOU.

      <h5>10.5 You agree to indemnify us.</h5>
      <p>
        In the event that any third party brings a claim against us related to

        &ldquo;Claim&rdquo;), you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us and
        our agents harmless from and against any and all third party claims,
        losses, liabilities, damages, and/or costs (including reasonable
        attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs) relating to such Claim. We will notify
        you promptly of any such Claim and will provide you with reasonable
        assistance, at your expense, in defending any such Claim; provided,
        however, that our failure to so notify you shall not relieve you of your
        indemnity obligations with respect to such Claim, but instead shall
        reduce those obligations by the amount of damages or increased costs and
        expenses attributable to our failure to give notice. We reserve the
        right to approve counsel retained by you, to take control of the defense
        (at our expense), and to participate in the defense of any Claim (at our
        expense) for which indemnity is required. You may not settle any Claim
        without our prior consent.

    <h4>11. Resolving Disputes</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <h5>11.1 Contact us if you have any questions or concerns.</h5>
      <p>
        If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about the Services,
        your User Account, these Terms, or anything else, please contact our
        support team at support@river.com. We may ask you certain information
        about you and your User Account to respond to your inquiry.
      </p>
      <h5>11.2 You must follow our internal complaint process.</h5>
      <p>
        If our support team is unable to resolve your complaint, you must send
        us a complaint. Please include a description of your complaint, the
        resolution you are seeking, and any other relevant information. If you
        do not follow the formal complaint process described above before
        seeking arbitration or other legal action, we may seek to dismiss your
        claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you&rsquo;ve initiated a complaint, we will investigate your claim.
        This may include reviewing the information you&rsquo;ve provided and the
        information available to us. In certain cases, we may need to contact
        you to obtain additional information. Upon conclusion of the
        investigation, we will send you an email notice indicating whether we
        approve or reject the resolution you are seeking. If we deem
        appropriate, we may also offer to resolve your complaint through an
        alternative solution. We will aim to resolve your complaint within 15
        business days of the date you submit your complaint. However, if we are
        unable to do so, we will inform you in writing and specify the deadline
        by which we will make a determination, which will not be more than 35
        business days from the date you submitted your complaint.
      </p>
      <h5>11.3 You and River agree to arbitrate any disputes.</h5>
      <p>
        If we are unable to resolve your complaint through the process described
        above, you agree to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy with
        River arising out of or relating to your use of the Services, regardless
        of the legal theory, in the following manner. First, we both agree to
        attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute through mediation
        administered by JAMS, which shall take place in San Francisco,
        California, and the costs of which shall be divided equally between you
        and River. Second, if the dispute is not resolved through informal
        resolution and mediation, we both agree to participate in binding
        arbitration administered by JAMS, which shall take place in San
        Francisco, California.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either you or we may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief
        without first engaging in the dispute resolution process described
        above.
      </p>
      <p>
        We both agree that, in the event of arbitration, or in the event of a
        lawsuit as permitted by this Section or otherwise, the prevailing party
        shall be entitled to costs and fees (including reasonable
        attorneys&rsquo; fees). Arbitration pursuant to this Section shall be
        confidential, and neither you, nor River, nor the arbitrator may
        disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as
        may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement or appeal of the
        arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in
        any court having proper jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <h5>11.4 You waive the right to class action and jury trial.</h5>
      <p>
        THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS SUBJECT TO THIS
        ARBITRATION CLAUSE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED
        BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE
        CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
        AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL).
      </p>
      <p>
        YOU AND RIVER EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
        BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
        AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any portion of this arbitration agreement is determined by a court to
        be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full
        force and effect. Nothing contained in this Section shall limit our
        ability to take action related to your access to the Services as
        provided in these Terms.
      </p>
      <h5>11.5 Delaware law will govern these Terms.</h5>
      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
        without regard to conflict of law provisions.
      </p>
      <h5>11.6 We agree to resolve disputes in San Francisco, California.</h5>
      <p>
        In the event that a lawsuit is filed where permitted under the
        provisions above, or in the event that the provisions above are found
        not to apply to you or to a given dispute, we both agree that any
        judicial proceeding will be brought in the federal or state courts
        located in San Francisco, California. Both you and we consent to venue
        and personal jurisdiction there.
      </p>

        party.
      </p>
